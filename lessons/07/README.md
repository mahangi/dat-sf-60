> NOTE 2: The Titanic survival dataset was chosen for this lesson because it is interesting, easy to understand, and commonly used in other tutorials. This dataset is also used in an official Kaggle tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which might be useful for students who want to explore Kaggle or the dataset further.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Compute** dot products, matrix multiplications, and vector norms by hand and using NumPy.
- **Code** summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile range, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.
- **Create** basic data visualizations - including: scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
- **Describe** characteristics and trends in a dataset using visualizations.
- **Describe** the bias and variance of statistical estimators.
- **Identify** a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- State the definition and application of an array in Python 
- Perform basic data manipulation and exploration in Pandas
- Recall basic tenants of linear algebra
